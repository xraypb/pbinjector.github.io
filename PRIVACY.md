PB Injector Privacy Policy

Last update 2023-02-06

PB Injector respects and protects the personal privacy of all users, so we make this privacy policy public to the public.
Your use of PB Injector means that you have read and agreed to these terms,
if you do not agree to these terms, please stop using and uninstall PB Injector immediately.

1. Collect message

   The PB Injector software itself does not send any information to the developer, but the application market where you download the software (such as Google Play) may collect relevant information about the running status of the application and provide it to the PB Injector developer. For this information, please read the privacy policy provided by the marketplace you use.

   The PB Injector software may contain features that need to be unlocked via IAP payment, your payment information will be processed by the relevant IAP channel and we do not have access to the payment information.

   When you report errors in the software operation to the PB Injector developers, the developers may ask you to provide software and system logs to help confirm the cause of the problem. Since the logs may contain sensitive information, such information should only be sent by yourself. We do not make any express or implied guarantee for the security and privacy of any transmission service. Please choose a method that is acceptable to you when transmitting relevant information.

2. Information Sharing

   We do not sell collected user data to any third party. We may provide information to external developers to assist in the development of the software, but we will communicate the relevant confidentiality obligations and determine that they can be complied with before providing the information.

3. information retention

   Unless required by law, we will clear user data that is no longer required within 30 days, or aggregate statistics into aggregated reports that do not identify individual users.

4. information leakage

   We will try our best to protect users' data using reasonable technical and security means, but we cannot guarantee the absolute security of data. If we confirm that data has been compromised, we will notify users through available channels within 7 days. You agree not to hold us accountable for any loss caused by force majeure.

5. Terms Modification

   We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy, but will ensure that users are notified via our available channels and in-app alerts at least 30 days before updating the terms. By continuing to use the software after the new terms take effect, you agree to the revised privacy terms.
